Reduction of artifacts in capacitive EEG

Electroencephalography (EEG) is an important medical resource for diagnosis, but traditional acquisition systems with resistive electrodes demand a lot of time before and after a measurement. One attempt to overcome this problem is capacitive EEG (cEEG) where non-contact capacitive electrodes are used. However, the main hold back to this system are motion artifacts caused by the movement of the electrodes. The aim of this thesis is to assess some of the most eï¬€ective algorithms used in traditional EEG to denoise the measurements, giving special attention to motion artifacts and SSVEP signals.
